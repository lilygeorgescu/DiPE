### ðŸŒŸ Overview
We propose a novel strategy to generate ensembles of different architectures for medical image segmentation, by leveraging the diversity (decorrelation) of the models forming the ensemble. More specifically, we utilize the Dice score among model pairs to estimate the correlation between the outputs of the two models forming each pair. To promote diversity, we select models with low Dice scores among each other.
